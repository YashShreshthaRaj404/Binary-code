#### Binary Code
is the most basic form of computer code, consisting of two numbers: 0 and 1. These numbers form the basic layer of all computing systems and are the primary language of digital technologies. Binary code uses combinations of these two numbers to represent numbers, letters, or other types of information.

## Importance of binary code
The binary number system is the base of all computing systems and operations. It enables devices to store, access and manipulate all types of information directed to and from the CPU or memory. This makes it possible to develop applications that enable users to do the following:

•view websites
•create and update documents
•play games
•view streaming video and other kinds of graphical information
•access software and 
perform calculations and data analyses.

##### The binary schema of digital 1s and 0s offers a simple and elegant way for computers to work. It also offers an efficient way to control logic circuits and to detect an electrical signal's true (1) and false (0) states.

## How Binary Numbers Work

The binary system is the primary language of computing systems. Inside these systems, a binary number consists of a series of eight bits. This series is known as a byte. In the binary schema, the position of each digit determines its decimal value. Thus, by understanding the position of each bit, a binary number can be converted into a decimal number.

In decimal numbers, each additional place is multiplied by 10 as we move from right to left (first place, 10th place, 100th place, etc.). But, in binary numbers, each additional place while moving from right to left is multiplied by two. The two examples below explain this idea.

##### Example 1
Here's how the decimal values are calculated for an 8-bit (byte) binary number 01101000.

In this number, the first digit is at the far right, while the eighth digit is at the far left. The second (0) to the seventh (1) digits are read from right to left.

As the bit position increases from one to eight, the previous decimal value is multiplied by two. That's why the first bit has a value of 1, the second bit has a value of 2, the third bit has a value of 4 and so on.

The final value of the decimal number is calculated by adding the individual values from the above table. However, only those values where the bit equals 1 should be added. These values represent the "on" position. The 0s represent the "off" position, so they are not counted in the decimal value calculation.

So, for the binary number 01101000, the decimal value is calculated as the following:

8 + 32 + 64 = 104

Here's how the decimal values are calculated for the binary number 11111111.

In this binary number, every bit has a value of 1, so all the individual values are added.

So, for this number, the decimal value is the following:

1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16+ 32 + 64 +128 = 255
